|---------|-------------|
| CRN-1 | Ensuring data privacy and compliance with institutional policies is critical as the system will handle sensitive student, lecturer, and administrative information. To address these concerns, it is vital that the system enforces access controls, secure authentication through SSO, and adherence to university data protection and retention regulations.|
| CRN-2 | It is essential that the system maintains consistent availability, the performance of the system is essential to ensure users can rely on the system during peak academic periods, such as exams or registration. The platform must meet uptime targets, handle high concurrent usage, and recover gracefully from failures or outages. |
| CRN-3 |  Managing seamless integration with various university data systems (LMS, registration, calendar, and email) requires reliable synchronization mechanisms and standardized APIs. The system must maintain information current across all linked services, manage communication failures graciously, and guarantee data consistency. |
| CRN-4 | Managing AI model versions, optimizing speed, and making sure the assistant accurately interprets a range of user intentions are all part of this topic. Effective natural language processing, learning from past user interactions, and model updates to ensure relevance are all necessary for AI to provide precise, context-aware replies.  |
